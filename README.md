# libpktwallet

This is a fork of btcwallet which provides library functions that are used
by both [pktwallet](https://github.com/pkt-cash/pktwallet) and
[neutrino](https://github.com/pkt-cash/neutrino).

[btcwallet](https://github.com/btcsuite/btcwallet) and
[neutrino](https://github.com/lightninglabs/neutrino) have a circular dependency
so in order to simplify development, btcwallet has been split in half.
